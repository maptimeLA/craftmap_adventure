### Materials & Costs

#### Individual

Item | Cost | Notes
-----|------|-------
Embroidery Hoop | $2 | 6-7" is a good manageable size |
Fabric | ~$.50 assuming a yield of nine 12" x 12" squares per yard, at a cost of $2/yard at JoAnn's for cotton muslin | A plain woven fabric in cotton or linen.  Muslin is cheap and works well. |
Tapestry or Chenille Needles | $.25 | Size 20-24 should be fine.  You want the sharp tip of a chenille needle if your fabric has a tight weave.  Smaller numbers mean bigger needles.  A bigger needle might be better if you want to use thicker threads or you have difficulty threading the eye. |
Embroidery Floss in your choice of colors | varies | Price can vary from $.40 to $.75 for each skein.  They come in variety packs as well. |

### Instructions

1. Separate the hoop's inner and outer rings.

2. Center the fabric over the inner hoop and press down the outer ring over the fabric.

3. Tighten the screw on the outer ring, gently pulling the fabric taut if necessary.  

4. The side with the fabric flush against the ring is the top.  Flip it over so the top is flush against your table for easy tracing.

5. Center the template on the fabric and trace with the washable marker.

6. Remove the fabric from the hoop and flip it over.  Put the fabric back in the hoop so the tracing is now on the top.

7. Outline and decorate your state with your choice of embroidery stitches.  Embroidery floss comes as 6 strands twisted together.  It is typically separated into 2 sets of 3 strands, or 3 sets of 2 strands.
