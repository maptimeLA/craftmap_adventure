# Intro Workshop

## Project: State Map

### Material

* embroidery hoop (6"-7" is a good manageable size)
* woven cotton/linen fabric (muslin is a cheap easy to use fabric) cut into a square roughly twice the size of your hoop
* chenille embroidery needle (size 18-24, depending on how tight your fabric is and how big you want the eye of the needle to be)
* embroidery floss in your choice of colors
* washable transfer pen ([like this one](https://www.amazon.com/DMC-U1539-Embroidery-Transfer-Blue/dp/B000W5HTX4))
* posterboard template of your choice of state (we found one for [California here](http://www.vectorportal.com/maps/north-america/california-outline-map/3336.aspx))

### Instructions

1. Separate the hoop's inner and outer rings.

2. Center the fabric over the inner hoop and press down the outer ring over the fabric.

3. Tighten the screw on the outer ring, gently pulling the fabric taut if necessary.  

4. The side with the fabric flush against the ring is the top.  Flip it over so the top is flush against your table for easy tracing.

5. Center the template on the fabric and trace with the washable marker.

6. Remove the fabric from the hoop and flip it over.  Put the fabric back in the hoop so the tracing is now on the top.

7. Outline and decorate your state with your choice of embroidery stitches.
