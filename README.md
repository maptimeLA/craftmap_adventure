Open Source Quilt using OSM data for anyone to jump in an contribute

##Proposal
This repo is to plan, discuss a quilt making project using data from openstreetmap to make "fabric tiles" made by anyone to add on to the quilt. This repo will also be a source for any city to make their own as we'll outline steps to hold workshops and instructions for putting the quilt together

##Steps for a workshop

1. Setup a meeting!
 * Create a title like "Let's make a quilt!!" or "Needles and crafts and maps oh my!"
 * When setting up a meeting, let people know about the materials cost
2. Meeting breakdown
