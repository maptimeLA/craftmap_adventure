Open Source Embroidered Quilt using OSM data for anyone to jump in an contribute

## Proposal
This repo is to plan, discuss a quilt making project using data from openstreetmap to make "fabric tiles" made by anyone to add on to the quilt. This repo will also be a source for any city to make their own as we'll outline steps to hold workshops and instructions for putting the quilt together

## Breakdown of what this is
* Basically we use openstreetmap data to create an embroidered quilt map of "fabric tiles." 
* The area is entirely up to the group or individuals who are leading the effort.
* The area to be quilted is broken down into a grid that can be printed for people to craft using embroidery or cross-stitching.
* Anyone can help with the effort, workshops should be held to teach how to go about crafting.
* Crafters would take a tile, complete it and add more information onto the tile based on their knowledge and research of the area being crafted.
* Crafters would hand their completed tiles to the project leaders for addition to the quilt.
* The quilt could be hung in public view so that others can find out and participate in the project.
* In the end, if there is any (it could be this giant quilt that spans a mile) people would get together to learn about crafting and maps all the learning about their city and bringing a sense of togetherness.
* The specifications for this project will be developed iteratively through trial and error.

## Steps for a workshop

1. Plan workshop:
 * Stitch guides.
 * Create basic patterns: state outline + major cities, local city outlines, local rail/transit networks, local geography, lettering.
 * Quilt project specifications.
2. Set up a meeting!
 * Create a title like "Let's make a quilt!!" or "Needles and crafts and maps oh my!"
 * When setting up a meeting, let people know about the materials cost.
3. Meeting breakdown:
 * Introductions
 * Teach embroidery stitches.
 * Start a simple embroidery project.
 * Introduce the quilt project.
