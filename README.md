Open Source Quilt using OSM data for anyone to jump in an contribute

##Proposal
This repo is to plan, discuss a quilt making project using data from openstreetmap to make "fabric tiles" made by anyone to add on to the quilt. This repo will also be a source for any city to make their own as we'll outline steps to hold workshops and instructions for putting the quilt together

##Breakdown of what this is
* Basically we use openstreetmap data to create a quilted map of "fabric tiles." 
* The area is entirely up to the group or individuals who are leading the effort.
* The area to be quilted is broken down into a grid that can be printed for people to craft using embroidery or cross-stitching.
* Anyone can help with the effort, workshops should be held to teach how to go about crafting.
* Crafters would take a tile, complete it and add more information onto the tile based on their knowledge of the area being crafted.
* Crafters would hand their completed tiles to the project leaders for addition to the quilt.
* Thoughts of where the quilt could be hung in public view so that others can find out and participate in the project.


##Steps for a workshop

1. Setup a meeting!
 * Create a title like "Let's make a quilt!!" or "Needles and crafts and maps oh my!"
 * When setting up a meeting, let people know about the materials cost
2. Meeting breakdown
 * Introductions
 * Start a simple embroidery and crosstitch
 * Introduce the quilt project
