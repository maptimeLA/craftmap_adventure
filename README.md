This project an Open Source Embroidered Quilt using OSM data for anyone to jump in and contribute to.  Slides from the workshop: https://slides.com/ninakin/maptime-embroidery#/

## Proposal
This repo is to plan and discuss a quilt making project using data from OpenStreetMap.  By making a quilt of "fabric tiles", anyone can  add to the quilted map. This repo will also be a source for any city to replicate the project and make their own map quilt.  We will outline steps for workshops and list instructions for putting the quilt together.

## Breakdown of what this is
* Basically we use OpenStreetMap data to create an embroidered quilt map of "fabric tiles." 
* The area is entirely up to the group or individuals who are leading the effort.
* The area to be quilted is broken down into a grid that can be printed for people to craft using embroidery or cross-stitching.
* Anyone can help with the effort, workshops should be held to teach how to go about crafting.
* Crafters would take a tile, complete it and add more information onto the tile based on their knowledge and research of the area being crafted.
* Crafters would hand their completed tiles to the project leaders for addition to the quilt.
* The quilt could be hung in public view so that others can find out and participate in the project.
* In the end, if there is an end (it could be this giant quilt that spans a mile), people would get together to learn about crafting and maps all the learning about their city and bringing a sense of togetherness.
* The specifications for this project will be developed iteratively through trial and error.

## Steps for a workshop

1. Plan an intro workshop:
 * Choose a basic pattern, for example: state outline + major cities, local city outlines, local rail/transit networks, local geography, lettering.
2. Set up a meeting!
 * Create a title like "Let's make a quilt!!" or "Needles and crafts and maps oh my!"
 * When setting up a meeting, let people know about the materials cost.
3. Meeting breakdown:
 * Introductions
 * Teach embroidery stitches.
 * Start a simple embroidery project.
 * Introduce the quilt project.

## Steps for the quilt project

1. Create quilt project specifications:
  * Choose features to include.
  * Decide on standard thread colors and stitch types.
  * Decide on Open Street Map tile zoom level.
2. Create a webpage to select the Open Street Map tiles for printing.
3. Set up a meeting.
4. Meeting breakdown:
  * Introductions
  * Introduce quilt project.
  * Separate participants into 2 groups: those we need stitch instruction and those who don't.
  * Have the beginners do the intro workshop project.
  * Have the others pick a tile and start on the quilt project.

## More Ideas

* Find a community partner willing to display the finished (or growing) quilt.
  * Opodz in Little Tokyo?
  * The Craft and Folk Art Museum (CAFAM) in Mid-Wilshire?
* Other embroidered map project ideas:
 * Transit systems - LA Metro rail, freeway networks, cross-country rail lines, etc.
 * Natural features - mountains, rivers, forests, etc.
 * Various world map projections - Mercator, Gall-Peters, Robinson, Winkel-Tripel, Dymaxion/Fuller, Goode Homolosine, etc.
 * Fictional maps - Narnia, Westeros, Middle Earth, etc.
